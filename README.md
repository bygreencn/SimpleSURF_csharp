Simple SURF (S-Surf)
====================
This is a simplified version of
SURF algorithm(based on the same principles)

------
* Algorithm is sensitive to rotation
and scale(max rotation angle is 15 degrees)
* Hessian values are computed for each
pixel(interpolation isn't implemented)
* For high resolution images requires lots of time
