Simple SURF (S-Surf)
   
This is a simplified version of
SURF algorithm(based on the same
principles)
1)Algorithm is sensitive to rotation
and scale(max rotation angle is 15 degrees)
2)Hessian values are computed for each
pixel(interpolation isn't implemented)
3)For high resolution images requires lots of time
